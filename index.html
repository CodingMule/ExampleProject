<p> City Tech was founded in 1946 as The New York State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences.
The urgent mission at the time was to provide training to GIs returning from the Second World War
and to provide New York with the technically proficient workforce it would need to thrive in the emerging post-war economy.
From its beginnings as an Institute—to being chartered as a community college—and subsequently transitioning to 
senior college status during the 1980s—it has grown from serving 246 students in 1946, to a population today of more than 30,000 degree and non-degree seeking students.</p>
